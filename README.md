# MissionDemolition

This is a Unity Project.

I did best scores for the levels, the slingshot's rubber band, and 3 past trajectories.

I also used Git extensively; I don't know if that could count for extra credit.
Even if it doesn't, I'm glad I did it.
GitHub for Unity is a little buggy.  It was nice to have source tree as a backup.
    I set up a remote as a private repository on my GitHub account.
    For each feature, I created a new branch and merged them when I was done.
